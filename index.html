    <h2>In 2016, Almost No Women Spoke at Austin Tech and Data Meetups Either</h2>
    <hr id='top-line'>
    <h3> Amalie Barras // December 11, 2016 </h3>
    <p class="content"> This project is a fork of Kate Rabinowitz's <a href="http://www.datalensdc.com/meetupSpeakers.html" class="link">original analysis</a> of tech meetups in DC. I came across this project after meeting her during a visit to Austin, and decided I wanted to repeat this analysis for Austin to hopefully encourage other cities to do it to. I encourage you to read more about her <a href = "http://www.datalensdc.com/meetupSpeakers.html" class="link">project.</a>
      <br><br>
    I always thought of Austin as a not bad place for women in technology, based on all the women meetup groups, the emphasis on diversity I hear when I go to them, and the amazing women I meet in person. But in researching this project I found  <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/best-cities-for-women-in-tech-2016" class="link" target="_blank">this report</a> which has Austin well-below the national average on a number of diversity stats, including only % of women filling tech jobs. (Austin is at 21%, and the national average is 27%.) <br><br>And while our meetup scene is hot and thriving -- among the <a hred = "https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/04/23/whos-meeting-up-a-ranking-of-top-startup-cities/">top 10 by members</a> in the US! -- I've also discovered that the proportion of meetup speakers (16.3%) is even lower than the 21% figure of women in tech jobs in Austin.
    <br><br>
    The thing that I loved most about this project was the solution. Kate created <a class="link" target=_"blank" href="http://wespeaktoo.org/">wespeaktoo.org</a> to help promote women speakers in DC, and offered to host <a href="http://www.wespeaktoo.org/austin" class="link">We Speak Too Austin!</a>.
    <br><br>

    For the analysis, I looked at the top 50 meetups in Austin and eliminated the ones without speaker events. These all had greater than 1500 members. I also omitted women-specific events which I will explain later. Amazingly, this still left me with 44 groups. I sorted the group list by number of members and picked every third group as a sample. Then, I pulled the events for that group, returning 255 events. <br><br>

    I noted whether or not these events were speaker events, and tallied the male and female speakers for each.

    The results were somewhat more promising than DC, but still disappointing. Only eleven women spoke at single-speaker events in Austin. Out of 74.

    Startup Founder had more women than men at single-speaker events, but no women spoke at their multi-speaker events.</p>

    <div class="singleSmall">
    <iframe width="100%" height="550px" src="./iframes/meetupSingleSmall.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p class="content">Multi-speaker events overall did feature more women, and technically at higher rates (17.1%, or 25 out of 146 speakers were women) But 10 of this 25 came from the wordpress group where the same woman leads a regular workshop. I didn't go through and deduplicate all speakers, but in theory that would reduce this number to less than 10%.
    <br><br>

    <div class="multiBig">
    <iframe width="100%" height="475px" src="./iframes/meetupMultiBig.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="multiSmall">
    <iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="./iframes/meetupMultiSmall.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p class="content">Of the 255 speaking slots, only 14.5% were women. As Kate explains, "This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects. Marginalized groups miss out on opportunities to be presented as leaders or experts in their fields. They are less likely to feel welcome to such groups, missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities. The result can be a feedback loop that works against diversity in the field."
    <br><br>

    These graphs do not include the data for non-binary people because they did not speak at any of the 114 events. But they are also a part of this community and deserve to be heard.
    <br><br>

    Although this data tells a strong story, we are not calling anyone sexist or intentionally exclusive of women. Kate goes on to say, "The speaker gap likely grows from ingrained networks and implicit bias. But as large, professional communities these meetups should consider it their responsibility to more accurately reflect, and champion, diversity in the industry."
    <br><br>

    And actually, many women in Austin tech have made homes for themselves in organizations like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Austin/">Women Who Code</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-ATX//">PyLadies</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/ChickTech-Austin//">ChickTech Austin</a>, and others. But we want non-female specific groups to work with these organizations to include women leaders.

    <br><br> At the very minimum, meetups should include a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2016/02/17/should-my-tech-conference-community-have-a-code-of-conduct-recommended-resources/">Code of Conduct</a>, as they are a very easy way to think about and show your meetup's commitment to diversity.
    <br><br>

    As I mentioned earlier, in an effort to bridge this speaker gap Kate created <a class="link" target=_"blank" href="http://wespeaktoo.org/">wespeaktoo.org</a>, and we are working together to create <a class="link" target=_"blank" href="http://wespeaktoo.org/">wespeaktoo.org/austin</a>. It is an open source list of area women and non-binary people interested in speaking at data and tech events. Please share and add yourself to the list. Women and non-binary people deserve a place on the stage.</p>

    <p class='content'><b>Technical notes:</b> Data was collected through the Meetup API. Austin modifications were made by me, Alex Ford, and Dashiel Mendez-Lopez. Original code was written by Kate and her group.
